            <h2>Announcing WickedJS: Defying Gravity in the World of JavaScript Libraries</h2>
            <p>January 13, 2025 — Somewhere Over the JavaScript Rainbow</p>

            <p>Today, I’m thrilled to announce the release of WickedJS, a JavaScript library that promises to make your
                projects as enchanting as a Broadway performance and twice as dramatic. After countless hours of
                development (and singing show tunes in my head), I present to you a library that doesn’t just solve
                problems—it redefines what it means to write JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Because apparently everything now involves the musical Wicked ... <code>WickedJS</code> brings together
                the best parts of JavaScript with just the right
                amount of flair. This isn’t just another library—it’s a phenomenon.</p>

            <h3>Features That Will Leave You Changed for Good</h3>

            <h4>1. “Defy Gravity” Async Functions</h4>
            <p>
                Say goodbye to callbacks weighing you down! WickedJS introduces <code>defyGravity()</code>, an
                asynchronous utility
                that makes promises look like amateur magic tricks. Your code will soar above the mundane with syntax so
                smooth it feels like Elphaba herself cast a spell on it.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import { defyGravity } from 'wickedjs';
                    
                    await defyGravity(fetch('/api/data'), 
                    { fallback: 'I’m through accepting limits!' });
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h4>2. The “Popular” Styling Utility</h4>
            <p>
                With WickedJS, CSS class manipulation is easier—and sassier—than ever. <code>The makePopular()</code>
                function
                automatically adds trending class names to your DOM elements, ensuring they’re always the star of the
                show.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import { makePopular } from 'wickedjs';
                    
                    makePopular(document.querySelector('.btn'), 'greenify', 'sparkle');
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>One click, and your buttons will look like ever other thing out there right now.</p>

            <h4>3. “For Good” State Management</h4>
            <p>
                Tired of state that is crazier than flying monkeys? WickedJS introduces a state management system so
                intuitive, it feels like a heartfelt ballad between two witches who finally understand each other.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import { forGood } from 'wickedjs';

                    const [state, setState] = forGood({ isDefying: true });
                    setState({ isDefying: false });
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>No more messy Redux setups or obscure hooks—just state that works, for good.</p>

            <h4>4. “No One Mourns the Garbage” Collection</h4>
            <p>
                Our automatic garbage collector ensures that no one mourns those forgotten variables. Memory leaks? Not
                in our Emerald City.
            </p>

                spells
