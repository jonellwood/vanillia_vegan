            <h2>The Monday Morning Code Test: Is Your Code Really Well-Commented?</h2>

            <p>We've all been there. You sit down on Monday morning, coffee in hand, ready to continue that feature you
                were working
                on last Friday afternoon. You open your code editor and—bam—you have no idea what you were doing. The
                logic seems
                foreign, the variables meaningless, and you’re left piecing together your own thought process like some
                kind of
                forensic investigator.</p>

            <p>This is what I call <strong>The Monday Morning Code Test</strong>, and it's the ultimate measure of
                whether your code
                is properly commented.</p>

            <h2>Why Friday Afternoon Code is a Nightmare</h2>
            <p>Friday afternoons are when good coding practices go to die. You’re trying to finish up just enough to
                justify a
                weekend break, half-distracted by thoughts of dinner, errands, or that show you’re binge-watching. The
                last hour is
                often a rush, with code written in a mix of inspiration and exhaustion, and then you close your laptop,
                thinking,
                <em>I’ll pick this up easily on Monday.</em>
            </p>

            <p>Spoiler: You won’t.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Good Comments</h2>
            <p>This is where good comments come in. They aren’t just for teammates or future developers—they’re for
                <em>you</em>
                when you become future you. Comments should act as a guide through your past thought process, answering
                these key
                questions:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>What does this code do?</strong> – A clear, high-level explanation of the purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Why does it do it this way?</strong> – Justifying design choices, especially if they aren’t
                    obvious.
                </li>
                <li><strong>What’s left to do?</strong> – If you stopped mid-way, what still needs attention?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Bare Minimum Test</h2>
            <p>Imagine that on Monday morning, you had to <strong>hand your code to someone else</strong> (or worse—your
                least
                favorite coworker). Would they be able to pick it up quickly without asking you a dozen questions? If
                not, your
                comments probably need work.</p>

            <h2>Commenting Strategies That Save Your Sanity</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with a "Here’s what’s happening" comment:</strong> A single line at the top of your
                    function or
                    block explaining its purpose is often enough to jog your memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Leave breadcrumbs for unfinished work:</strong> If you were midway through a change, leave a
                    comment
                    like <code>// TODO: Implement error handling here</code> so you remember where you left off.</li>
                <li><strong>Explain non-obvious decisions:</strong> If you had to take an unusual approach to solve a
                    problem, write
                    down why. Future you will appreciate it.</li>
                <li><strong>Use meaningful variable and function names:</strong> While not comments, clear naming
                    reduces the need
                    for excessive explanations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Real Test: Take a Break and Return</h2>
            <p>A good way to test your own commenting habits is to leave a piece of code alone for a week and then try
                to resume
                work. If you can instantly recall what’s going on, congrats—your comments are solid. If not, well,
                future-you just
                learned a valuable lesson.</p>

            <p>So, the next time you’re about to shut down on a Friday, ask yourself: <em>Will Monday me thank Friday me
                    for
                    this?</em> If the answer isn’t a confident yes, take a moment to leave some notes. Your future self
                will be
                grateful.</p>
