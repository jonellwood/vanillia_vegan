<p>I found myself wondering why do we (mainly I) apologize for something, and moreover why <em>should</em> we apologize for something.</p>

<h2> The Impetus</h2>

<p>The other morning on the way to work I accidentally cut someone off as I pulled onto a road. As I was clearly being negligent in my driving, and knowing how infuriating something like that can be - when we came to a stop sign a couple of hundred yards up I popped out to quickly apologize.</p>

<p>I quickly opened my door and looked back at the driver behind me. I then made the universal "my bad" signal by tapping my chest and said "<em>I am so sorry</em>". I even managed to have a friendly smile on my face.</p>

<p>The guy was not happy! He gave me a mean look and pointed forward towards my vehicle to say "get back in your vehicle and get out of my way!". I got back in my vehicle, feeling slighting humiliated and drove off - probably a bit faster than I would have normally. As I drove I thought about what a jerk that guy was! How dare he not immediately accept my apology? Then I started thinking ...</p>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<b><em>Why_ was I angry?</em></b>

<p>At the core of it - I was angry because the other persons response did not meet with _my_ preset expectation of what it should have been. How dare that guy not just absolve me of my guilt, tell me what a good person I am, and allow me to drive off feeling great about myself?? 😡</p>

<h3>Let's break this sequence of events down here shall we?</h3>

<ol>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></b> pull into the roadway and cut someone off </li>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></b> then delay their travels so that <b><mark>I<mark></b> can apologize and <b><mark>I<mark></b> can feel better</li>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></b> get angry when the response isn't what <b><mark>I<mark></b> expected </li>
</ol>

<p><b><mark>I<mark></b> and starting to think <b><mark>I<mark></b> am the cause of my anger here....</p>

<p>I was angry when his response didn't meet with <em>my</em> expectations.... how was he supposed to know what I expected?</p>

<p>After coming to this conclusion I felt .... well I felt silly to be honest. But then I asked <em>"Why do I apologize?"</em> Do I apologize to help alleviate some level of pain (or annoyance in the case) I have caused someone else? Or do I apologize to make myself feel better? I think I know what the answer should be; but I think I also know what the answer is in many cases.</p>

<h2>Does the intent matter</h2>

<p>I think it clearly does. In this case I allowed anger into my day 100% because of a situation I caused and then I reacted too.</p>

<h2>The Answer</h2>

<p>I was angry because, in essence, I didn't get what I wanted. I was angry because of my emotional immaturity.</p>

<b><em>So what's the fix?</em></b>

<p>I don't have a fix ... I can, and will, try to be more mindful of _why_ I feel the way I do, and try to be cognizant of the cause of those feelings (and when how much of that cause is me). That is about all I can do for now.</p>
