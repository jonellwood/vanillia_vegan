**<mark>WARNING: This post discusses poop. The good, the bad, and the smelly.</mark>**

Before going to a plant based diet I had frequent heartburn, painful gas in my chest (that one time I thought was a heart attack it was so painful), and diarrhea almost all the time. I tried different OTC medications which may have lessened the symptoms from time to time - but never addressed the issue. I lived like that so long it just became my normal.

A plant based diet changed all this for the better.

## Obligatory Disclaimer

I am not a doctor. I don't mean that in the funny way like at the end of Brooklyn 911. I'm really not. This is an account of my experience - like poop - yours may vary.

## Bristol Stool Chart

**wait what??**

I know. I was surprised too. There is a poo chart, it's a real thing. There is even a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale) entry, so you know it has to be real! _It is also on WebMD and other sites as well._ Including [continence.org](https://www.continence.org.au/bristol-stool-chart) which is where the image below comes from.

According the interwebs, the ideal poo is a 3 or 4 on the chart. (_Side note:_ both of them being described as 'like a sausage ... #goVegan.)

## My experience

Since going to a plant based diet I have been consistently passing a four on the chart. Don't worry - no photos included. (_Unless you join my Patreon at the brown level._)

<p>OMG I am totally kidding. I have no Patreon, I have no poop photos. Sorry to disappoint.</p>

For the first two weeks there was A LOT of four.... but four all the same. Ever since it has been a consistent four. It is a joy to poop now. Every morning, consistent consistency, and no real cramping to speak of.

## The downside ?

### The amount of gas I produce is amazing

Seriously, I was _not_ prepared for the amount of gas my stomach started producing on a plant based diet. It is not painful gas, it is not particularly foul smelling, but there is a lot of it. But it has also had benefits.

I work in an open office area with open cubicles. It is mostly developers or server admins and we are a very quiet bunch. With that in mind I usually like to go for a quick 10 minute walk a few times a day. A few laps around the building certainly is not bad for my overall health, but also a much needed time to release some built up pressure.

If you see me outside walking, wave at me. When I wave back, know there is a good chance I am farting while I do it. 😈
